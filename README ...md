# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project
This repository contains all the material for the Coursera course "Data Analyst" from IBM. The course is focused on teaching the skills needed to become a data analyst, including data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

As I continue the course, I will be uploading additional materials such as code, Jupyter notebooks, and project files.

The materials in this repository are organized by module, with each module containing a set of files and resources specific to that module's content.
